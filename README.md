# Helluuu worlddddd
Welcome to my readme page! I'm today's year-old when I started getting serious about learning coding (2024/10). 
I'm in a non-coding job that's kind of busy with long hours, and most of my experience in coding so far has been self-taught. This year I've enrolled in a masters program in biomedical engineering, and I've only just started on the prerequisites. I would like to keep a record of my learning and maybe share some of my projects if I can. Growing in terms of programming feels tedious but I'm optimistic.
